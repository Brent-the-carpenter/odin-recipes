The odin project recipes is a test to show my skills of using Html to create a website that includes three pages that have recipes on each of them. Each page will need to include an relitave path link from the home page to the desired reipe page. i also will be including pictures of each recipe finished on the home page and also on the corsponding picture to each page.

I will be using my new knowledge of links, headings, paragrahps, italics, bloding, ordered and unorder list and images in this project.
